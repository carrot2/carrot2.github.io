However, for the vast majority of applications only minor tweaks to the defaults are really needed. For example, adding ignorable terms and phrases specific to a given domain is a very helpful step to increase clustering quality (patent documents will have a different lexicon compared to an unrestricted e-mail corpus, for example). Let's take a look at how this is done first.","_targetLowerCodes":[101,97,99,104,32,111,102,32,116,104,101,32,105,110,116,101,114,102,97,99,101,115,32,111,102,32,97,32,108,97,110,103,117,97,103,101,32,99,111,109,112,111,110,101,110,116,32,99,97,110,32,98,101,32,111,118,101,114,114,105,100,100,101,110,46,32,104,111,119,101,118,101,114,44,32,102,111,114,32,116,104,101,32,118,97,115,116,32,109,97,106,111,114,105,116,121,32,111,102,32,97,112,112,108,105,99,97,116,105,111,110,115,32,111,110,108,121,32,109,105,110,111,114,32,116,119,101,97,107,115,32,116,111,32,116,104,101,32,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,115,32,97,114,101,32,114,101,97,108,108,121,32,110,101,101,100,101,100,46,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,44,32,97,100,100,105,110,103,32,105,103,110,111,114,97,98,108,101,32,116,101,114,109,115,32,97,110,100,32,112,104,114,97,115,101,115,32,115,112,101,99,105,102,105,99,32,116,111,32,97,32,103,105,118,101,110,32,100,111,109,97,105,110,32,105,115,32,97,32,118,101,114,121,32,104,101,108,112,102,117,108,32,115,116,101,112,32,116,111,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,113,117,97,108,105,116,121,32,40,112,97,116,101,110,116,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,104,97,118,101,32,97,32,100,105,102,102,101,114,101,110,116,32,108,101,120,105,99,111,110,32,99,111,109,112,97,114,101,100,32,116,111,32,97,110,32,117,110,114,101,115,116,114,105,99,116,101,100,32,101,45,109,97,105,108,32,99,111,114,112,117,115,44,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,41,46,32,108,101,116,39,115,32,116,97,107,101,32,97,32,108,111,111,107,32,97,116,32,104,111,119,32,116,104,105,115,32,105,115,32,100,111,110,101,32,102,105,114,115,116,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[4,4,4,4,5,7,7,8,11,11,11,12,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,23,25,25,26,27,28,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,37,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,47,50,50,50,51,53,53,54,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,65,66,73,73,73,73,73,73,73,74,75,78,78,78,79,82,82,82,83,87,87,87,87,88,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,97,99,99,100,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,113,117,117,117,117,118,123,123,123,123,123,124,130,130,130,130,130,130,131,133,133,134,137,137,137,138,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,147,150,150,150,151,157,157,157,157,157,157,158,164,164,164,164,164,164,165,166,169,169,169,170,177,177,177,177,177,177,177,178,179,185,185,185,185,185,185,186,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,201,201,201,201,201,202,205,205,205,206,213,213,213,213,213,213,213,214,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,223,225,225,226,227,228,233,233,233,233,233,234,240,240,240,240,240,240,241,243,243,244,245,246,250,250,250,250,251,258,258,258,258,258,258,258,259,263,263,263,263,264,266,266,267,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,276,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,287,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,295,296,302,302,302,302,302,302,303,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,313,317,317,317,317,318,322,322,322,322,323,324,325,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,335,342,342,342,342,342,342,342,343,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,352,354,354,355,357,357,358,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,371,372,373,377,377,377,377,378,384,384,384,384,384,384,385,386,389,389,389,390,397,397,397,397,397,397,397,398,399,400,403,403,403,404,405,406,410,410,410,410,411,412,413,417,417,417,417,418,420,420,421,424,424,424,425,429,429,429,429,430,432,432,433,437,437,437,437,438,443,443,443,443,443,444],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"A clustering algorithm in Carrot2 may support only a subset of the languages available from the LanguageComponentsProvider extension point.

When set to true, clusters will contain only the documents that contain the cluster's label in its original form, including the order of words. Enabling this option will cause fewer documents to be put in clusters, increasing the precision of assignment, but also increasing the \"Other Topics\" group. Disabling this option will cause more documents to be put in clusters, which will make the \"Other Topics\" cluster smaller, but also lower the precision of cluster-document assignments.","_targetLowerCodes":[111,110,108,121,32,101,120,97,99,116,32,112,104,114,97,115,101,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,115,46,32,119,104,101,110,32,115,101,116,32,116,111,32,116,114,117,101,44,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,32,111,110,108,121,32,116,104,101,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,104,97,116,32,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,32,116,104,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,39,115,32,108,97,98,101,108,32,105,110,32,105,116,115,32,111,114,105,103,105,110,97,108,32,102,111,114,109,44,32,105,110,99,108,117,100,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,111,114,100,101,114,32,111,102,32,119,111,114,100,115,46,32,101,110,97,98,108,105,110,103,32,116,104,105,115,32,111,112,116,105,111,110,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,97,117,115,101,32,102,101,119,101,114,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,111,32,98,101,32,112,117,116,32,105,110,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,44,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,112,114,101,99,105,115,105,111,110,32,111,102,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,44,32,98,117,116,32,97,108,115,111,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,34,111,116,104,101,114,32,116,111,112,105,99,115,34,32,103,114,111,117,112,46,32,100,105,115,97,98,108,105,110,103,32,116,104,105,115,32,111,112,116,105,111,110,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,97,117,115,101,32,109,111,114,101,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,111,32,98,101,32,112,117,116,32,105,110,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,44,32,119,104,105,99,104,32,119,105,108,108,32,109,97,107,101,32,116,104,101,32,34,111,116,104,101,114,32,116,111,112,105,99,115,34,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,32,115,109,97,108,108,101,114,44,32,98,117,116,32,97,108,115,111,32,108,111,119,101,114,32,116,104,101,32,112,114,101,99,105,115,105,111,110,32,111,102,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,45,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,115,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[4,4,4,4,5,10,10,10,10,10,11,17,17,17,17,17,17,18,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,30,31,35,35,35,35,36,39,39,39,40,42,42,43,47,47,47,47,48,49,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,58,62,62,62,62,63,70,70,70,70,70,70,70,71,75,75,75,75,76,79,79,79,80,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,90,94,94,94,94,95,102,102,102,102,102,102,102,103,106,106,106,107,114,114,114,114,114,114,114,115,116,117,122,122,122,122,122,123,125,125,126,129,129,129,130,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,139,143,143,143,143,144,145,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,155,158,158,158,159,164,164,164,164,164,165,167,167,168,173,173,173,173,173,174,175,183,183,183,183,183,183,183,183,184,188,188,188,188,189,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,200,200,200,200,201,206,206,206,206,206,207,212,212,212,212,212,213,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,223,225,225,226,228,228,229,232,232,232,233,235,235,236,244,244,244,244,244,244,244,244,245,246,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,257,260,260,260,261,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,271,273,273,274,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,285,286,289,289,289,290,294,294,294,294,295,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,306,309,309,309,310,311,316,316,316,316,316,317,323,323,323,323,323,323,324,325,330,330,330,330,330,331,332,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,342,346,346,346,346,347,353,353,353,353,353,353,354,358,358,358,358,359,364,364,364,364,364,365,369,369,369,369,370,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,380,382,382,383,385,385,386,389,389,389,390,392,392,393,401,401,401,401,401,401,401,401,402,403,408,408,408,408,408,409,413,413,413,413,414,418,418,418,418,419,422,422,422,423,424,429,429,429,429,429,430,436,436,436,436,436,436,437,438,445,445,445,445,445,445,445,446,453,453,453,453,453,453,453,454,455,458,458,458,459,463,463,463,463,464,469,469,469,469,469,470,473,473,473,474,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,484,486,486,487,494,494,494,494,494,494,494,495,503,503,503,503,503,503,503,503,504,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,516],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"Minimum required number of documents in each cluster.
