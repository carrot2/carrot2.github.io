A value of 1.0 means that all words will be taken into account, no matter in how many documents they appear.","_targetLowerCodes":[109,97,120,105,109,117,109,32,119,111,114,100,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,32,102,114,101,113,117,101,110,99,121,46,32,116,104,101,32,109,97,120,105,109,117,109,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,32,102,114,101,113,117,101,110,99,121,32,97,108,108,111,119,101,100,32,102,111,114,32,119,111,114,100,115,32,97,115,32,97,32,102,114,97,99,116,105,111,110,32,111,102,32,97,108,108,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,46,32,119,111,114,100,115,32,119,105,116,104,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,32,102,114,101,113,117,101,110,99,121,32,108,97,114,103,101,114,32,116,104,97,110,32,111,114,103,46,99,97,114,114,111,116,50,46,116,101,120,116,46,118,115,109,46,116,101,114,109,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,109,97,116,114,105,120,98,117,105,108,100,101,114,35,109,97,120,119,111,114,100,100,102,32,119,105,108,108,32,98,101,32,105,103,110,111,114,101,100,46,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,44,32,119,104,101,110,32,111,114,103,46,99,97,114,114,111,116,50,46,116,101,120,116,46,118,115,109,46,116,101,114,109,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,109,97,116,114,105,120,98,117,105,108,100,101,114,35,109,97,120,119,111,114,100,100,102,32,105,115,32,48,46,52,44,32,119,111,114,100,115,32,97,112,112,101,97,114,105,110,103,32,105,110,32,109,111,114,101,32,116,104,97,110,32,52,48,37,32,111,102,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,98,101,32,98,101,32,105,103,110,111,114,101,100,46,32,97,32,118,97,108,117,101,32,111,102,32,49,46,48,32,109,101,97,110,115,32,116,104,97,116,32,97,108,108,32,119,111,114,100,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,98,101,32,116,97,107,101,110,32,105,110,116,111,32,97,99,99,111,117,110,116,44,32,110,111,32,109,97,116,116,101,114,32,105,110,32,104,111,119,32,109,97,110,121,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,104,101,121,32,97,112,112,101,97,114,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,12,12,12,12,13,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,21,22,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,31,32,33,36,36,36,37,44,44,44,44,44,44,44,45,53,53,53,53,53,53,53,53,54,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,63,64,71,71,71,71,71,71,71,72,75,75,75,76,81,81,81,81,81,82,84,84,85,86,87,95,95,95,95,95,95,95,95,96,98,98,99,102,102,102,103,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,113,114,119,119,119,119,119,120,124,124,124,124,125,133,133,133,133,133,133,133,133,134,143,143,143,143,143,143,143,143,143,144,150,150,150,150,150,150,151,155,155,155,155,156,159,159,159,160,167,167,167,167,167,167,167,168,172,172,172,172,173,176,176,176,177,181,181,181,181,189,189,189,189,189,189,189,189,195,195,195,195,195,195,202,202,202,202,202,202,202,203,206,206,206,210,210,210,210,212,212,213,217,217,217,217,218,220,220,221,228,228,228,228,228,228,228,229,230,233,233,233,234,241,241,241,241,241,241,241,242,243,247,247,247,247,248,251,251,251,252,259,259,259,259,259,259,259,260,264,264,264,264,265,268,268,268,269,273,273,273,273,281,281,281,281,281,281,281,281,287,287,287,287,287,287,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,295,298,298,298,302,302,302,302,304,304,305,307,307,308,309,310,311,312,313,318,318,318,318,318,319,328,328,328,328,328,328,328,328,328,329,331,331,332,336,336,336,336,337,341,341,341,341,342,344,344,345,346,348,348,349,358,358,358,358,358,358,358,358,358,359,363,363,363,363,364,366,366,367,369,369,370,377,377,377,377,377,377,377,378,379,380,381,386,386,386,386,386,387,389,389,390,391,392,393,394,399,399,399,399,399,400,404,404,404,404,405,408,408,408,409,414,414,414,414,414,415,419,419,419,419,420,422,422,423,428,428,428,428,428,429,433,433,433,433,434,441,441,441,441,441,441,441,442,443,445,445,446,452,452,452,452,452,452,453,455,455,456,459,459,459,460,464,464,464,464,465,474,474,474,474,474,474,474,474,474,475,479,479,479,479,480,486,486,486,486,486,486,487],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"This attribute may be useful when certain words appear in most of the input documents (e.g. company name from header or footer) and such words dominate the cluster labels.

Let's take a look at how this is done first.","_targetLowerCodes":[101,97,99,104,32,111,102,32,116,104,101,32,105,110,116,101,114,102,97,99,101,115,32,111,102,32,97,32,108,97,110,103,117,97,103,101,32,99,111,109,112,111,110,101,110,116,32,99,97,110,32,98,101,32,111,118,101,114,114,105,100,100,101,110,46,32,104,111,119,101,118,101,114,44,32,102,111,114,32,116,104,101,32,118,97,115,116,32,109,97,106,111,114,105,116,121,32,111,102,32,97,112,112,108,105,99,97,116,105,111,110,115,32,111,110,108,121,32,109,105,110,111,114,32,116,119,101,97,107,115,32,116,111,32,116,104,101,32,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,115,32,97,114,101,32,114,101,97,108,108,121,32,110,101,101,100,101,100,46,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,44,32,97,100,100,105,110,103,32,105,103,110,111,114,97,98,108,101,32,116,101,114,109,115,32,97,110,100,32,112,104,114,97,115,101,115,32,115,112,101,99,105,102,105,99,32,116,111,32,97,32,103,105,118,101,110,32,100,111,109,97,105,110,32,105,115,32,97,32,118,101,114,121,32,104,101,108,112,102,117,108,32,115,116,101,112,32,116,111,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,113,117,97,108,105,116,121,32,40,112,97,116,101,110,116,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,104,97,118,101,32,97,32,100,105,102,102,101,114,101,110,116,32,108,101,120,105,99,111,110,32,99,111,109,112,97,114,101,100,32,116,111,32,97,110,32,117,110,114,101,115,116,114,105,99,116,101,100,32,101,45,109,97,105,108,32,99,111,114,112,117,115,44,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,41,46,32,108,101,116,39,115,32,116,97,107,101,32,97,32,108,111,111,107,32,97,116,32,104,111,119,32,116,104,105,115,32,105,115,32,100,111,110,101,32,102,105,114,115,116,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[4,4,4,4,5,7,7,8,11,11,11,12,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,23,25,25,26,27,28,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,37,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,47,50,50,50,51,53,53,54,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,65,66,73,73,73,73,73,73,73,74,75,78,78,78,79,82,82,82,83,87,87,87,87,88,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,97,99,99,100,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,113,117,117,117,117,118,123,123,123,123,123,124,130,130,130,130,130,130,131,133,133,134,137,137,137,138,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,147,150,150,150,151,157,157,157,157,157,157,158,164,164,164,164,164,164,165,166,169,169,169,170,177,177,177,177,177,177,177,178,179,185,185,185,185,185,185,186,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,201,201,201,201,201,202,205,205,205,206,213,213,213,213,213,213,213,214,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,223,225,225,226,227,228,233,233,233,233,233,234,240,240,240,240,240,240,241,243,243,244,245,246,250,250,250,250,251,258,258,258,258,258,258,258,259,263,263,263,263,264,266,266,267,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,276,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,287,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,295,296,302,302,302,302,302,302,303,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,313,317,317,317,317,318,322,322,322,322,323,324,325,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,335,342,342,342,342,342,342,342,343,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,352,354,354,355,357,357,358,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,371,372,373,377,377,377,377,378,384,384,384,384,384,384,385,386,389,389,389,390,397,397,397,397,397,397,397,398,399,400,403,403,403,404,405,406,410,410,410,410,411,412,413,417,417,417,417,418,420,420,421,424,424,424,425,429,429,429,429,430,432,432,433,437,437,437,437,438,443,443,443,443,443,444],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"Clustering algorithms may support a subset of languages and language component instances assembled manually.

More than that may cause problems due to in-memory processing.","_targetLowerCodes":[112,114,111,118,105,100,101,32,97,32,109,105,110,105,109,117,109,32,111,102,32,49,48,48,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,46,32,99,97,114,114,111,116,50,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,97,108,103,111,114,105,116,104,109,115,32,119,111,114,107,32,98,101,116,116,101,114,32,119,105,116,104,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,105,110,103,32,97,109,111,117,110,116,32,111,102,32,100,97,116,97,46,32,97,32,104,117,110,100,114,101,100,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,111,110,32,105,110,112,117,116,32,105,115,32,112,114,111,98,97,98,108,121,32,116,104,101,32,109,105,110,105,109,117,109,32,102,111,114,32,97,110,121,32,115,116,97,116,105,115,116,105,99,97,108,32,115,105,103,110,105,102,105,99,97,110,99,101,32,111,102,32,102,101,97,116,117,114,101,115,32,100,105,115,99,111,118,101,114,101,100,32,98,121,32,116,104,101,32,97,108,103,111,114,105,116,104,109,46,32,105,110,32,103,101,110,101,114,97,108,44,32,97,110,32,111,112,116,105,109,117,109,32,110,117,109,98,101,114,32,111,102,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,111,117,108,100,32,112,114,111,98,97,98,108,121,32,102,97,108,108,32,98,101,116,119,101,101,110,32,49,48,48,32,97,110,100,32,97,32,102,101,119,32,116,104,111,117,115,97,110,100,115,46,32,109,111,114,101,32,116,104,97,110,32,116,104,97,116,32,109,97,121,32,99,97,117,115,101,32,112,114,111,98,108,101,109,115,32,100,117,101,32,116,111,32,105,110,45,109,101,109,111,114,121,32,112,114,111,99,101,115,115,105,110,103,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[7,7,7,7,7,7,7,8,9,10,17,17,17,17,17,17,17,18,20,20,21,24,24,24,25,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,34,35,36,43,43,43,43,43,43,43,44,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,54,55,65,65,65,65,65,65,65,65,65,65,66,70,70,70,70,71,77,77,77,77,77,77,78,82,82,82,82,83,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,93,94,100,100,100,100,100,100,101,103,103,104,108,108,108,108,109,110,111,112,119,119,119,119,119,119,119,120,129,129,129,129,129,129,129,129,129,130,132,132,133,138,138,138,138,138,139,141,141,142,150,150,150,150,150,150,150,150,151,154,154,154,155,162,162,162,162,162,162,162,163,166,166,166,167,170,170,170,171,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,183,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,198,198,199,207,207,207,207,207,207,207,207,208,218,218,218,218,218,218,218,218,218,218,219,221,221,222,225,225,225,226,235,235,235,235,235,235,235,235,235,236,237,239,239,240,247,247,247,247,247,247,247,248,249,251,251,252,259,259,259,259,259,259,259,260,266,266,266,266,266,266,267,269,269,270,279,279,279,279,279,279,279,279,279,280,285,285,285,285,285,286,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,295,299,299,299,299,300,307,307,307,307,307,307,307,308,311,311,311,312,315,315,315,316,317,318,321,321,321,322,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,332,333,337,337,337,337,338,342,342,342,342,343,347,347,347,347,348,351,351,351,352,357,357,357,357,357,358,366,366,366,366,366,366,366,366,367,370,370,370,371,373,373,374,376,376,377,383,383,383,383,383,383,384,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,395],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"Provide query-context snippets instead of entire documents.
