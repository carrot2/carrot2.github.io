request.","_targetLowerCodes":[97,115,32,109,101,110,116,105,111,110,101,100,32,105,110,32,116,104,101,32,105,110,116,114,111,100,117,99,116,105,111,110,44,32,97,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,113,117,101,114,121,32,105,115,32,115,101,108,102,45,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,101,100,32,97,110,100,32,109,117,115,116,32,99,97,114,114,121,32,116,104,101,32,116,104,114,101,101,32,114,101,113,117,105,114,101,100,32,101,108,101,109,101,110,116,115,58,32,97,108,103,111,114,105,116,104,109,32,110,97,109,101,44,32,108,97,110,103,117,97,103,101,32,97,110,100,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,111,32,98,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,101,100,46,32,105,110,32,112,114,97,99,116,105,99,101,44,32,116,104,101,32,102,105,114,115,116,32,116,119,111,32,101,108,101,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,114,97,114,101,108,121,32,99,104,97,110,103,101,32,8211,32,111,110,99,101,32,116,104,101,32,97,108,103,111,114,105,116,104,109,32,102,111,114,32,97,32,112,97,114,116,105,99,117,108,97,114,32,116,97,115,107,32,105,115,32,99,104,111,115,101,110,44,32,105,116,32,119,105,108,108,32,112,114,111,98,97,98,108,121,32,114,101,109,97,105,110,32,99,111,110,115,116,97,110,116,32,102,111,114,32,97,108,108,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,115,46,32,105,110,32,115,105,116,117,97,116,105,111,110,115,32,108,105,107,101,32,116,104,105,115,32,119,101,32,99,97,110,32,112,117,108,108,32,111,117,116,32,116,104,101,32,99,111,110,115,116,97,110,116,32,112,97,114,116,32,111,102,32,116,104,101,32,113,117,101,114,121,32,105,110,116,111,32,97,32,116,101,109,112,108,97,116,101,32,97,110,100,32,117,115,101,32,98,97,115,105,99,32,99,111,109,112,111,115,105,116,105,111,110,32,119,105,116,104,32,116,104,101,32,98,111,100,121,32,111,102,32,97,32,113,117,101,114,121,32,116,111,32,103,101,116,32,116,104,101,32,102,105,110,97,108,32,114,101,113,117,101,115,116,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[2,2,3,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,12,13,15,15,16,19,19,19,20,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,32,33,34,35,36,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,47,52,52,52,52,52,53,55,55,56,60,60,60,60,61,70,70,70,70,70,70,70,70,70,71,74,74,74,75,79,79,79,79,80,85,85,85,85,85,86,89,89,89,90,95,95,95,95,95,96,104,104,104,104,104,104,104,104,105,113,113,113,113,113,113,113,113,114,115,124,124,124,124,124,124,124,124,124,125,129,129,129,129,130,131,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,139,140,143,143,143,144,153,153,153,153,153,153,153,153,153,154,156,156,157,159,159,160,169,169,169,169,169,169,169,169,169,170,171,173,173,174,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,182,183,184,187,187,187,188,193,193,193,193,193,194,197,197,197,198,206,206,206,206,206,206,206,206,207,211,211,211,211,212,218,218,218,218,218,218,219,225,225,225,225,225,225,226,227,228,232,232,232,232,233,236,236,236,237,246,246,246,246,246,246,246,246,246,247,250,250,250,251,252,253,263,263,263,263,263,263,263,263,263,263,264,268,268,268,268,269,271,271,272,278,278,278,278,278,278,279,280,282,282,283,287,287,287,287,288,296,296,296,296,296,296,296,296,297,303,303,303,303,303,303,304,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,313,316,316,316,317,320,320,320,321,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,331,332,340,340,340,340,340,340,340,340,341,342,344,344,345,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,355,356,360,360,360,360,361,365,365,365,365,366,368,368,369,372,372,372,373,377,377,377,377,378,381,381,381,382,385,385,385,386,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,394,395,399,399,399,399,400,402,402,403,406,406,406,407,412,412,412,412,412,413,417,417,417,417,418,419,420,428,428,428,428,428,428,428,428,429,432,432,432,433,436,436,436,437,442,442,442,442,442,443,454,454,454,454,454,454,454,454,454,454,454,455,459,459,459,459,460,463,463,463,464,468,468,468,468,469,471,471,472,473,474,479,479,479,479,479,480,482,482,483,486,486,486,487,490,490,490,491,496,496,496,496,496,497,504,504,504,504,504,504,504,505],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"Another

Disabling this option will cause more documents to be put in clusters, which will make the \"Other Topics\" cluster smaller, but also lower the precision of cluster-document assignments.","_targetLowerCodes":[111,110,108,121,32,101,120,97,99,116,32,112,104,114,97,115,101,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,115,46,32,119,104,101,110,32,115,101,116,32,116,111,32,116,114,117,101,44,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,32,111,110,108,121,32,116,104,101,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,104,97,116,32,99,111,110,116,97,105,110,32,116,104,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,39,115,32,108,97,98,101,108,32,105,110,32,105,116,115,32,111,114,105,103,105,110,97,108,32,102,111,114,109,44,32,105,110,99,108,117,100,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,111,114,100,101,114,32,111,102,32,119,111,114,100,115,46,32,101,110,97,98,108,105,110,103,32,116,104,105,115,32,111,112,116,105,111,110,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,97,117,115,101,32,102,101,119,101,114,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,111,32,98,101,32,112,117,116,32,105,110,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,44,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,112,114,101,99,105,115,105,111,110,32,111,102,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,44,32,98,117,116,32,97,108,115,111,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,105,110,103,32,116,104,101,32,34,111,116,104,101,114,32,116,111,112,105,99,115,34,32,103,114,111,117,112,46,32,100,105,115,97,98,108,105,110,103,32,116,104,105,115,32,111,112,116,105,111,110,32,119,105,108,108,32,99,97,117,115,101,32,109,111,114,101,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,116,111,32,98,101,32,112,117,116,32,105,110,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,115,44,32,119,104,105,99,104,32,119,105,108,108,32,109,97,107,101,32,116,104,101,32,34,111,116,104,101,114,32,116,111,112,105,99,115,34,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,32,115,109,97,108,108,101,114,44,32,98,117,116,32,97,108,115,111,32,108,111,119,101,114,32,116,104,101,32,112,114,101,99,105,115,105,111,110,32,111,102,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,45,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,32,97,115,115,105,103,110,109,101,110,116,115,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[4,4,4,4,5,10,10,10,10,10,11,17,17,17,17,17,17,18,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,29,30,31,35,35,35,35,36,39,39,39,40,42,42,43,47,47,47,47,48,49,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,57,58,62,62,62,62,63,70,70,70,70,70,70,70,71,75,75,75,75,76,79,79,79,80,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,89,90,94,94,94,94,95,102,102,102,102,102,102,102,103,106,106,106,107,114,114,114,114,114,114,114,115,116,117,122,122,122,122,122,123,125,125,126,129,129,129,130,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,138,139,143,143,143,143,144,145,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,154,155,158,158,158,159,164,164,164,164,164,165,167,167,168,173,173,173,173,173,174,175,183,183,183,183,183,183,183,183,184,188,188,188,188,189,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,200,200,200,200,201,206,206,206,206,206,207,212,212,212,212,212,213,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,223,225,225,226,228,228,229,232,232,232,233,235,235,236,244,244,244,244,244,244,244,244,245,246,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,256,257,260,260,260,261,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,270,271,273,273,274,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,284,285,286,289,289,289,290,294,294,294,294,295,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,305,306,309,309,309,310,311,316,316,316,316,316,317,323,323,323,323,323,323,324,325,330,330,330,330,330,331,332,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,341,342,346,346,346,346,347,353,353,353,353,353,353,354,358,358,358,358,359,364,364,364,364,364,365,369,369,369,369,370,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,379,380,382,382,383,385,385,386,389,389,389,390,392,392,393,401,401,401,401,401,401,401,401,402,403,408,408,408,408,408,409,413,413,413,413,414,418,418,418,418,419,422,422,422,423,424,429,429,429,429,429,430,436,436,436,436,436,436,437,438,445,445,445,445,445,445,445,446,453,453,453,453,453,453,453,454,455,458,458,458,459,463,463,463,463,464,469,469,469,469,469,470,473,473,473,474,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,483,484,486,486,487,494,494,494,494,494,494,494,495,503,503,503,503,503,503,503,503,504,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,515,516],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"Minimum required number of documents in each cluster.

Let's take a look at how this is done first.","_targetLowerCodes":[101,97,99,104,32,111,102,32,116,104,101,32,105,110,116,101,114,102,97,99,101,115,32,111,102,32,97,32,108,97,110,103,117,97,103,101,32,99,111,109,112,111,110,101,110,116,32,99,97,110,32,98,101,32,111,118,101,114,114,105,100,100,101,110,46,32,104,111,119,101,118,101,114,44,32,102,111,114,32,116,104,101,32,118,97,115,116,32,109,97,106,111,114,105,116,121,32,111,102,32,97,112,112,108,105,99,97,116,105,111,110,115,32,111,110,108,121,32,109,105,110,111,114,32,116,119,101,97,107,115,32,116,111,32,116,104,101,32,100,101,102,97,117,108,116,115,32,97,114,101,32,114,101,97,108,108,121,32,110,101,101,100,101,100,46,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,44,32,97,100,100,105,110,103,32,105,103,110,111,114,97,98,108,101,32,116,101,114,109,115,32,97,110,100,32,112,104,114,97,115,101,115,32,115,112,101,99,105,102,105,99,32,116,111,32,97,32,103,105,118,101,110,32,100,111,109,97,105,110,32,105,115,32,97,32,118,101,114,121,32,104,101,108,112,102,117,108,32,115,116,101,112,32,116,111,32,105,110,99,114,101,97,115,101,32,99,108,117,115,116,101,114,105,110,103,32,113,117,97,108,105,116,121,32,40,112,97,116,101,110,116,32,100,111,99,117,109,101,110,116,115,32,119,105,108,108,32,104,97,118,101,32,97,32,100,105,102,102,101,114,101,110,116,32,108,101,120,105,99,111,110,32,99,111,109,112,97,114,101,100,32,116,111,32,97,110,32,117,110,114,101,115,116,114,105,99,116,101,100,32,101,45,109,97,105,108,32,99,111,114,112,117,115,44,32,102,111,114,32,101,120,97,109,112,108,101,41,46,32,108,101,116,39,115,32,116,97,107,101,32,97,32,108,111,111,107,32,97,116,32,104,111,119,32,116,104,105,115,32,105,115,32,100,111,110,101,32,102,105,114,115,116,46],"_nextBeginningIndexes":[4,4,4,4,5,7,7,8,11,11,11,12,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,22,23,25,25,26,27,28,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,36,37,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,46,47,50,50,50,51,53,53,54,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,64,65,66,73,73,73,73,73,73,73,74,75,78,78,78,79,82,82,82,83,87,87,87,87,88,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,96,97,99,99,100,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,112,113,117,117,117,117,118,123,123,123,123,123,124,130,130,130,130,130,130,131,133,133,134,137,137,137,138,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,146,147,150,150,150,151,157,157,157,157,157,157,158,164,164,164,164,164,164,165,166,169,169,169,170,177,177,177,177,177,177,177,178,179,185,185,185,185,185,185,186,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,195,196,201,201,201,201,201,202,205,205,205,206,213,213,213,213,213,213,213,214,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,222,223,225,225,226,227,228,233,233,233,233,233,234,240,240,240,240,240,240,241,243,243,244,245,246,250,250,250,250,251,258,258,258,258,258,258,258,259,263,263,263,263,264,266,266,267,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,275,276,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,286,287,294,294,294,294,294,294,294,295,296,302,302,302,302,302,302,303,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,312,313,317,317,317,317,318,322,322,322,322,323,324,325,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,334,335,342,342,342,342,342,342,342,343,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,351,352,354,354,355,357,357,358,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,370,371,372,373,377,377,377,377,378,384,384,384,384,384,384,385,386,389,389,389,390,397,397,397,397,397,397,397,398,399,400,403,403,403,404,405,406,410,410,410,410,411,412,413,417,417,417,417,418,420,420,421,424,424,424,425,429,429,429,429,430,432,432,433,437,437,437,437,438,443,443,443,443,443,444],"score":null,"indexes":null,"obj":null}},{"searchable":"A clustering algorithm in Carrot2 may support only a subset of the languages available from the LanguageComponentsProvider extension point.
